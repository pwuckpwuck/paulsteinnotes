25-A1	A	Advent	1	2025-11-30	First Sunday of Advent	Gospel	Matthew	Matthew 24:36-44	"Matthew 24:36-44
Jesus said to the disciples, “But about that day and hour no one knows, neither the angels of heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father. For as the days of Noah were, so will be the coming of the Son of Man. For as in those days before the flood they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day Noah entered the ark, and they knew nothing until the flood came and swept them all away, so too will be the coming of the Son of Man. Then two will be in the field; one will be taken and one will be left. Two women will be grinding meal together; one will be taken and one will be left. Keep awake therefore, for you do not know on what day your Lord is coming. But understand this: if the owner of the house had known in what part of the night the thief was coming, he would have stayed awake and would not have let his house be broken into. Therefore you also must be ready, for the Son of Man is coming at an unexpected hour.”"

25-A1	A	Advent	1	2025-11-30	First Sunday of Advent	Commentary	Frederic Buechner	Listening to Your Life: Daily Meditations	"“Give us grace that we may cast away the works of darkness, and put upon us the armor of light, now in the time of this mortal life in which thy son Jesus Christ came to visit us in great humility: that in the last day, when he shall come again in his glorious majesty, to judge both the quick and the dead, we may rise to the life immortal.”
All the paradoxical themes of Advent are compressed into that handful of words, Christ coming at Christmas time in great humility and again at the end of time in glorious majesty—Christ coming as a child to save us and as a king to judge us—mortal life, immortal life...“Cast away the works of darkness,” they say, and put on “the armor of light.” Maybe those are the words that best sum up the paradox of who we are and where we are. Somewhere between the darkness and the light. That is where we are as Christians. And not just at Advent time, but at all times. Somewhere between the fact of darkness and the hope of light. That is who we are.

“Advent” means “coming” of course, and the promise of Advent is that what is coming is an unimaginable invasion…an invasion of holiness. That is what Advent is about. What is coming upon the world is the Light of the World. It is Christ. That is the comfort of it. The challenge of it is that it has not come yet. Only the hope for it has come, only the longing for it. In the meantime we are in the dark, and the dark, God knows, is also in us. We watch and wait for a holiness to heal us and hallow us, to liberate us from the dark. Advent is like the hush in a theater just before the curtain rises. It is like the hazy ring around the winter moon that means the coming of snow which will turn the night to silver. Soon. But for the time being, our time, darkness is where we are. "
25-A1	A	Advent	1	2025-11-30	First Sunday of Advent	Commentary	Michael Mayne	Responding to the Light	"Perhaps the real importance of Advent is in its reminder that as there was a beginning of creation, so there will be an end...Our purpose, our destiny, our proper end, is to come to know God himself, to respond with trust to his love in Jesus Christ, to respond with proper care, compassion and understanding to one another, and so find at last our completion, our fulfillment and our wholeness, as those who are made in God’s likeness.

But if part of our ultimate fulfillment is to lose our lonely isolation in the company of heaven, so the purpose of the world, the end of history, is the establishment of the Kingdom of God. That is what Jesus came to proclaim: God’s Kingdom. He lived it, preached it, suffered for it, died for it. And his victory over death was the greatest witness to its reality. His life and death and resurrection demonstrate once and for all the victory of good over evil. The Kingdom he reveals—life as God would have it—is the guarantee that war and disease and poverty are a violation of God’s will, and that in the end—however long it takes—good will triumph over evil, truth over the lie, freedom and justice over oppression, love over hate, light over darkness. That is our vision, our hope, the end we pray for every time we say ‘thy Kingdom come, thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven.’

Advent hope is much more than a political and social hope for freedom and prosperity. It is the hope of the Kingdom of God—the Kingdom which is to be fulfilled in God’s good time and in ways we cannot yet imagine. But a Kingdom too which since the first Christmas is already among us, a Kingdom of which every Eucharist is a tiny foretaste, and the Kingdom which (once our eyes are opened) keeps on breaking in in the most surprising ways and the most unexpected places. "
25-A2	A	Advent	2	2025-12-07	Second Sunday of Advent		Matthew	Matthew 3:1-12	"Matthew 3:1-12
In those days John the Baptist appeared in the wilderness of Judea, proclaiming, “Repent, for the kingdom of heaven has come near.” This is the one of whom the prophet Isaiah spoke when he said,

“The voice of one crying out in the wilderness:
‘Prepare the way of the Lord,
make his paths straight.’”
“The voice of one crying out in the wilderness:
‘Prepare the way of the Lord,
make his paths straight.’”

Now John wore clothing of camel’s hair with a leather belt around his waist, and his food was locusts and wild honey. Then the people of Jerusalem and all Judea were going out to him, and all the region along the Jordan, and they were baptized by him in the river Jordan, confessing their sins.

But when he saw many Pharisees and Sadducees coming for baptism, he said to them, “You brood of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the wrath to come? Bear fruit worthy of repentance. Do not presume to say to yourselves, ‘We have Abraham as our ancestor’; for I tell you, God is able from these stones to raise up children to Abraham. Even now the ax is lying at the root of the trees; every tree therefore that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.

“I baptize you with water for repentance, but one who is more powerful than I is coming after me; I am not worthy to carry his sandals. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire. His winnowing fork is in his hand, and he will clear his threshing floor and will gather his wheat into the granary; but the chaff he will burn with unquenchable fire.”"
25-A2	A	Advent	2	2025-12-07	Second Sunday of Advent	Reflection	Paul Stein	Paul's Notes	"Context: 
We’re now in Year A of the lectionary cycle, focusing on Matthew with some appearances from the Book of John. Matthew is writing for a Greek-speaking Jewish audience, scholars suggest in Syria, possibly Antioch. That is reflected even in this reading, for example, “Do not presume to say to yourselves, ‘We have Abraham as our ancestor’”

Looking ahead: Every year, John the Baptist is the focus of the 2nd and 3rd Sundays in Advent. Next week we skip ahead and see John in prison, where he sends emissaries to ask Jesus if indeed he’s the real deal.

In light of that—that John wasn’t sure if Jesus was the Messiah—I wonder if John’s description of Jesus here was off the mark.
[John the Baptist: “It may be that John is part of the Essene community, which was vigorously critical of both the Pharisees and the Sadducees.” Essenes: mystic, ascetic and communal Jewish sect from 2nd century BCE to 1st century CE. Thought to be the original authors/owners of the Dead Sea Scrolls. Ritually immersed in water every morning. Did not believe in personal property or money.]

John the Baptist appeared in the wilderness of Judea Why wilderness? Wouldn’t the most efficient way to reach the most people be to go to the city, to Jerusalem, maybe with a placard, and walk the sidewalks? Hanging out in the wilderness means that people have to make a significant effort and journey to be baptized and repent. Thoughts?

‘Prepare the way of the Lord, make his paths straight.’
- Repentance and humility open a path for God into our lives.
- But this verse might also imply that, in addition to repentance, we need to stop sinning. Isn’t that impossible? God doesn’t require us to be perfect in order to save us and bring us into the Kingdom (despite Matthew admonishing to “be perfect” at the end of the Sermon on the Mount.)
- Sin is so much bigger than just doing bad things. It’s mortality and the suffering of the world, both human and natural. We cannot get rid of sin. Only God can do that. 

and they were baptized by him in the river Jordan, confessing their sins Why do Episcopalians not do confession like Catholics? We confess our sin corporately, and there is provision for private individual confession, but it’s not mandatory.

But when he saw many Pharisees and Sadducees coming for baptism, he said to them, “You brood of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the wrath to come? Why is John so negative towards Pharisees and Sadducees, who, as sinners, are coming for baptism (and presumably repentance)?
- If they are there to repent, why not welcome them? Isn’t John just hardening their hearts?
- Or is John saying that they’re insincere: coming out for blessings and cleansing, but not really changing their hearts / repenting?
every tree therefore that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire and the chaff he will burn with unquenchable fire.
- Sounds really harsh. What do we make of this? 
- Perhaps a connection to the burning bush, which was not consumed by fire? If so, the fire is not destructive but somehow divine, refining.
- Typically harsh of Matthew, who more than the other Gospels preaches judgment
Commentary: emphasis really does not fall on the coming of Jesus as a baby in Bethlehem, but rather on the coming of Jesus as the Judge of all things at the end of all time. Agree/disagree? What do we make of Advent? How do we observe it?

25-A2	A	Advent	2	2025-12-07	Second Sunday of Advent	Commentary	Michael Mayne	To Trust and To Love: Sermons and Addresses	"He’s a disturbing figure, John, standing in the desert like some roughly-dressed hermit and quoting Isaiah, that prophet who 700 years earlier had spoken words of comfort to the Jewish refugees exiled in Babylon and given them a vision of a new and restored creation. Isaiah who had spoken of another prophet who would come to be a voice crying in the wilderness. And John the Baptiser says: ‘I am that voice’ as he urges the people to repent and so be ready for the God who is about to reveal his Word in a dramatically new and decisive way.

…Many people think that the Christian faith is basically saying: ‘Do this!’ or ‘Don’t do that!’ It isn’t. It’s saying: ‘Look! Pay attention! Look at God and his creation and each other with changed eyes because of what you see in Christ.’ Those who seek to communicate the Christian faith should be (like John the Baptist) saying: ‘Don’t look at me—look at him. Listen to his word as he speaks of the Mystery, for he alone of all our human race saw into the heart of God and said that his name is Father and his nature Love’

…So John the Baptist looks at Jesus of Nazareth and says: ‘Look closely at this man who comes to me to be baptized and you will see his glory.’ And what the Christian faith says is: ‘Come and see what life and death look like, in the light of Christ, so that you may learn not to fear them. And come and see what God looks like, and what the world looks like, and what every man, woman and child looks like, in the light of Christ so that you may learn to love them. He is not only the window into what God is like, but into what it means to be human’."
25-A2	A	Advent	2	2025-12-07	Second Sunday of Advent	Commentary	Michael Mayne	To Trust and To Love: Sermons and Addresses	"For us the word ‘repent’ may seem a dark and threatening word, which we equate with feelings of guilt. It fails to express that life-changing experience of which the Gospels speak, in which Jesus freed people of their fear and guilt and defensiveness and they were able to find in him forgiveness and the kind of security they had never known. Perhaps the word has unhappy overtones for some of us because too many of those who have preached repentance have preached hell-fire and turned the Gospel of love into a Gospel of fear, and so have distorted the Gospel of Jesus whose constant concern was to bring men and women to a realization of the astonishing nature of God’s love for them…

Now in the New Testament the word ‘repent’ doesn’t mean taking some action which is negative and backward-looking, wringing your hands and indulging in an agony of guilt. On the contrary, repentance means looking at Jesus. It describes a shift in your understanding, a sudden recognition of an extraordinary truth: the truth of God’s unconditional love for you. Repentance is my instinctive response to the discovery that I am loved by God in a way past my imagining. A repentance then becomes the regular recognition of how little we still understand what that truth means and how little we act upon it; of how unconverted we remain. "
25-A2	A	Advent	2	2025-12-07	Second Sunday of Advent	Commentary	Fleming Rutledge	Advent: The Once and Future Coming of Jesus Christ	"John’s divinely ordained location in the world according to the New Testament, is on the frontier of the ages as God arrives in his world to turn it away from its past of sin and bondage toward a future of promise and freedom. John’s function is to proclaim the coming reversal of the downward spiral of human history, to deliver the message of the invading Son of God…

The whole purpose of John the Baptist is to announce the beginning of the end. His appearance on the banks of the Jordan River means that the kingdom of God has begun. The wickedness of this world is truly doomed; the Lord of the universe is about to step on the stage of world history to reverse its course. "
25-A2	A	Advent	2	2025-12-07	Second Sunday of Advent	Commentary	Fleming Rutledge, 	Advent: The Once and Future Coming of Jesus Christ	I have an Advent wreath in my dining room just like many of you, but it does occur to me from time to time that the soft, romantic glow of candlelight fails to do justice to the conflagration announced by John. The extremely odd thing about Advent, in spite of its reputation as a season of preparation for Christmas, is that its emphasis really does not fall on the coming of Jesus as a baby in Bethlehem, but rather on the coming of Jesus as the Judge of all things at the end of all time. The overwhelming presence of John the Baptist in the lectionary in this season drives the point home; his announcement of the imminent arrival of the Messiah comes thirty years after Jesus’s birth, and is intended to summon the people to repentance in preparation for Jesus’s adult ministry. John does not proclaim Jesus as a captivating infant smiling benevolently at groups of assorted rustics, potentates, and farm animals; instead he cries out, “One is coming after me that is mightier than I....His winnowing fork is in his hand and he will clear his threshing floor, gathering the wheat into his barn and burning up the chaff with unquenchable fire.”
25-A3	A	Advent	3	2025-12-14	Third Sunday of Advent	Gospel	Matthew	Matthew 11:2-11	"Matthew 11:2-11
When John heard in prison what the Messiah was doing, he sent word by his disciples and said to him, “Are you the one who is to come, or are we to wait for another?” Jesus answered them, “Go and tell John what you hear and see: the blind receive their sight, the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, and the poor have good news brought to them. And blessed is anyone who takes no offense at me.”

As they went away, Jesus began to speak to the crowds about John: “What did you go out into the wilderness to look at? A reed shaken by the wind? What then did you go out to see? Someone dressed in soft robes? Look, those who wear soft robes are in royal palaces. What then did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I tell you, and more than a prophet. This is the one about whom it is written,

‘See, I am sending my messenger ahead of you,
who will prepare your way before you.’

“Truly I tell you, among those born of women no one has arisen greater than John the Baptist; yet the least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he.”"
25-A3	A	Advent	3	2025-12-14	Third Sunday of Advent	Reflection	Paul Stein	Paul's Notes	"N. T. Wright: Actually, Jesus wasn’t the only one at the time who thought the Messiah would be characterized by acts of healing. Also Isaiah 35 which is the OT reading this Sunday.

This story is also in Luke 7. 

John was in prison because he criticized King Herod Antipas [ruler of Galilee and Perea] for marrying his brother's ex-wife Herodias. “But when Herod’s birthday came, the daughter of Herodias danced before the company, and she pleased Herod so much that he promised on oath to grant her whatever she might ask. Prompted by her mother, she said, “Give me the head of John the Baptist here on a platter.”

So we have two sections: 1st about John in prison, main question is why is he asking about Jesus?

Then Jesus’ reply, somewhat enigmatic, with the final line, “yet the least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he”. 

When John heard in prison what the Messiah was doing, he sent word by his disciples 
- Wonder if it was kind of like an *ahem* moment, like “Hey, Hello there, I’m in prison, you’re doing all these miracles, how about a miracle to spring me from this joint?” 
- Like maybe having an earthquake where all the doors of the prison open, like in Acts with Paul. 
- Which, if you follow this line of thought, since that doesn’t happen, it means Jesus leaves John in prison to die.
- Historically Jesus and John remained separate, with separate groups of disciples. Jesus doesn’t try to poach John’s disciples.

“Are you the one who is to come, or are we to wait for another?”
Do we agree with the commentary, that John is looking for fire and brimstone from Jesus (see last week’s reading) and isn’t seeing it—so that’s what is motivating this question?
This question conflicts with what we traditionally think about John—that he’s 100% with the program (even when he was still in his mother’s womb, i.e. Luke where he leaps when Mary shows up). A few themes here.
- Power: Jesus seems weak to some. John is looking for power. This hasn’t changed 2,000 years later. So many people are drawn to power in this world. Why is that? Seems tribal, animalistic 
- Expectations: Jesus isn’t doing what John thinks he should  be doing. Isn’t that the basis of the secular world? God doesn’t do what people think God should be doing? For example, God should rescue people and banish suffering.
- Some expectations are wrong, but aren’t some also right? Like God is love? Jesus offers salvation? What is appropriate to expect, and not appropriate? How do we know?
- Questioning: it’s okay to question or doubt God

And blessed is anyone who takes no offense at me.
- Why would anyone back then take offense at Jesus’s healing ministry? (as long as it’s not on a Sabbath)
- Why would anyone take offense today?

A reed shaken by the wind Someone who blows one way or another depending on who is in power. 
yet the least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he. What do we make of this? 
- Does it mean that kingdom of heaven > this world. I.e. you can’t exceed or compete with the kingdom of heaven by being a great ruler or prophet.
- Or, since we are in the kingdom of heaven now, we’re greater than John.

How does this reading fit in with Advent? Waiting for the Messiah. Patient. Epistle reading from James admonishes, “Be patient”"
25-A3	A	Advent	3	2025-12-14	Third Sunday of Advent	Commentary	N. T. Wright	Matthew for Everyone	"Jesus is actually one jump ahead, in the story-line, of where John thinks he should be. John wants him to bring judgment—and so, in a sense, he will. But already the mercy which comes after judgment, the healing which comes after the time of sorrow, is breaking in, and it’s Jesus’ job to bring it. This according to Jesus (and Matthew), is the Messiah’s main task. 

Actually, Jesus wasn’t the only one at the time who thought the Messiah would do things like this. In one of the Dead Sea Scrolls found at Qumran there’s a passage which predicts that when the Messiah comes he will heal the sick, raise the dead, bring good news to the poor, and so on…

But mercy was at the heart of Jesus’ messianic mission, just as it remains at the heart of the church’s work today. Whether or not that’s the script people want us to follow, that’s the way we’ve got to go. And Jesus invokes a special blessing on people who realize that this is the true story—which turns into a coded warning to those who are puzzled, including poor John himself. This is where and how God is at work. Those who recognize it, and are not offended because they were expecting something else, will know God’s blessing."
25-A3	A	Advent	3	2025-12-14	Third Sunday of Advent	Commentary	N. T. Wright	Matthew for Everyone	John’s stark warnings set the tone for much of the story of Jesus. John prepared the way, not knowing what it would actually look like when God’s kingdom arrived; and John was himself puzzled at the outcome. Jesus’ own mission was quite different from what people sometimes imagine; the comfort and healing of his kingdom-message was balanced by the stern and solemn warning that when God comes back he demands absolute allegiance. If God really is God, he isn’t simply the kindly, indulgent, easy-going parent we sometimes imagine. 
25-A3	A	Advent	3	2025-12-14	Third Sunday of Advent	Commentary	Fleming Rutledge 	Advent: The Once and Future Coming of Jesus Christ	"John the Baptist was full of doubts about Jesus, because he was not the kind of Messiah that John or anyone else had expected. John could not understand why nothing messianic and grand was happening. John could not understand why Jesus wasn’t doing anything revolutionary or cataclysmic. John did not understand why God was not inaugurating his powerful kingdom with apocalyptic splendor then and there. 

Jesus gave John a strange answer…Jesus’s quotation is a paraphrase of the famous prophecy from Isaiah:

The eyes of the blind shall be opened,
And the ears of the deaf unstopped;
Then shall the lame man leap like a hart,
And the tongue of the dumb sing for joy (Isaiah 35:5-6)

When Jesus gave this answer to John, he must have counted on the fact that John would instantly understand what he was saying…Jesus refers John the Baptist to the great eighth-century prophet, knowing that John, more than any other human being, would understand that in Jesus’s seemingly enigmatic words, the decisive event of salvation history is being described.
