A,Advent,1,Paul Stein,Note,Reflection,Note: Advent 1 is often the week of Thanksgiving when the group doesn’t meet. 
A,Advent,1,Matthew,24:36-44,Gospel,"Jesus said to the disciples, “But about that day and hour no one knows, neither the angels of heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father. For as the days of Noah were, so will be the coming of the Son of Man. For as in those days before the flood they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day Noah entered the ark, and they knew nothing until the flood came and swept them all away, so too will be the coming of the Son of Man. Then two will be in the field; one will be taken and one will be left. Two women will be grinding meal together; one will be taken and one will be left. Keep awake therefore, for you do not know on what day your Lord is coming. But understand this: if the owner of the house had known in what part of the night the thief was coming, he would have stayed awake and would not have let his house be broken into. Therefore you also must be ready, for the Son of Man is coming at an unexpected hour.”"
A,Advent,2,Frederic Buechner,Listening to Your Life: Daily Meditations,Commentary,"“Give us grace that we may cast away the works of darkness, and put upon us the armor of light, now in the time of this mortal life in which thy son Jesus Christ came to visit us in great humility: that in the last day, when he shall come again in his glorious majesty, to judge both the quick and the dead, we may rise to the life immortal.” 
All the paradoxical themes of Advent are compressed into that handful of words, Christ coming at Christmas time in great humility and again at the end of time in glorious majesty—Christ coming as a child to save us and as a king to judge us—mortal life, immortal life...“Cast away the works of darkness,” they say, and put on “the armor of light.” Maybe those are the words that best sum up the paradox of who we are and where we are. Somewhere between the darkness and the light. That is where we are as Christians. And not just at Advent time, but at all times. Somewhere between the fact of darkness and the hope of light. That is who we are. 
“Advent” means “coming” of course, and the promise of Advent is that what is coming is an unimaginable invasion…an invasion of holiness. That is what Advent is about. What is coming upon the world is the Light of the World. It is Christ. That is the comfort of it. The challenge of it is that it has not come yet. Only the hope for it has come, only the longing for it. In the meantime we are in the dark, and the dark, God knows, is also in us. We watch and wait for a holiness to heal us and hallow us, to liberate us from the dark. Advent is like the hush in a theater just before the curtain rises. It is like the hazy ring around the winter moon that means the coming of snow which will turn the night to silver. Soon. But for the time being, our time, darkness is where we are. "
A,Advent,3,Michael Mayne,Responding to the Light,Commentary,"Perhaps the real importance of Advent is in its reminder that as there was a beginning of creation, so there will be an end...Our purpose, our destiny, our proper end, is to come to know God himself, to respond with trust to his love in Jesus Christ, to respond with proper care, compassion and understanding to one another, and so find at last our completion, our fulfillment and our wholeness, as those who are made in God’s likeness. 
But if part of our ultimate fulfillment is to lose our lonely isolation in the company of heaven, so the purpose of the world, the end of history, is the establishment of the Kingdom of God. That is what Jesus came to proclaim: God’s Kingdom. He lived it, preached it, suffered for it, died for it. And his victory over death was the greatest witness to its reality. His life and death and resurrection demonstrate once and for all the victory of good over evil. The Kingdom he reveals—life as God would have it—is the guarantee that war and disease and poverty are a violation of God’s will, and that in the end—however long it takes—good will triumph over evil, truth over the lie, freedom and justice over oppression, love over hate, light over darkness. That is our vision, our hope, the end we pray for every time we say ‘thy Kingdom come, thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven.’
Advent hope is much more than a political and social hope for freedom and prosperity. It is the hope of the Kingdom of God—the Kingdom which is to be fulfilled in God’s good time and in ways we cannot yet imagine. But a Kingdom too which since the first Christmas is already among us, a Kingdom of which every Eucharist is a tiny foretaste, and the Kingdom which (once our eyes are opened) keeps on breaking in in the most surprising ways and the most unexpected places. "
A,Christmas,4,Barbara Brown Taylor,"Barbara Brown Taylor, God in Pain: Teaching Sermons on Suffering",Commentary,"Every single Gospel writer introduces Jesus by talking about John, which means that in some way or another the Doberman is God's idea. John is the watchdog who makes sure no one wanders into holy precincts unaware. He is the guard dog, who tests all those who think they want in. Anyone who cannot handle him cannot handle the one who comes after him. As different as they will turn out to be, John's judgment precedes Jesus' grace. They go together, like night and day, because those who know nothing of judgment need nothing of grace.
John's business was repentance. It was what his baptism was all about. It was not about becoming a Christian, because John was not a Christian. He had followers of his own, disciples who would become critics of the disciples of Jesus. So it is important not to confuse John's baptism with the one we know about. When John waded into the water with people, he was cleaning them up for their audience with God, which he believed would take place very soon. He begged them to change their lives in preparation for that event, and he was not below scaring them half to death if that was what it took—anything to wake them up and make them see that they were sleepwalking through their lives, most of them, confusing their own ways with God's ways and accumulating sin like an empty house accumulates dust."
A,Easter,,Amy-Jill Levine,Light of the World: A Beginner’s Guide to Advent,Commentary,"The texts that will become the Old Testament typically speak of salvation as an event that occurs in history, as in being saved from war, hunger, disease, plague, and oppression. For people in Luke's church, salvation comes to mean salvation from sin and death. But it must also keep that original focus on the desperate needs of people in our own time. Salvation means that there is respite from whatever oppresses in the community that hears, and lives, this Gospel. Men and women, slaves and free people, all come together to say, ""In our midst, we have a savior."" For Jesus to be a savior and for the good news to function as salvific, the Gospel says that we do not need to wait until some far-flung future. We can see salvation in the actions of the past, as at the Exodus, where Miriam and Moses insisted on freedom. We can see it in the present, as Luke's parable of the good Samaritan demonstrates. And we can anticipate it tomorrow, if we simply follow John the Baptist's instruction: share what you have with those in need."
B,Advent,,Fleming Rutledge,Means of Grace: A Year of Weekly Devotions,Commentary,"It is God’s power that gives good deeds and inner strength and spiritual discipline and faith and repentance. We are able to repent and bear fruit because he is coming.
What does it all mean? It means any number of things. It means that you are being changed and I am being changed. It means that we Christians are going to be weaned away from our possessions and oriented toward being everlastingly possessed by the love of God. It means that we will become less interested in receiving personal blessings for ourselves and more interested in making Christian hope known to those who “sit in darkness.” It means that we will become more and more thankful as we become less and less self-righteous. It means that we will gradually become less preoccupied with our own privileges and prerogatives and gradually see ourselves more and more in solidarity with other human beings who, like us, can receive mercy only from the hand of God and not because of any human superiority. Repentance will mean seeking after the good of all, not just the comforts of a few. "
B,Advent,,Fleming Rutledge,Means of Grace A Year of Weekly Devotions,Commentary,"If we ignore passages like this—in other words, if we jump straight to Christmas without observing Advent—we will fail to understand the nature of the grace of God that comes to us even though we “provoke God to his face continually.” Advent teaches us to recognize this grace, to turn aside from our own devices, and to wait in the darkness with patience for the promised time of fulfillment.
To be sure, Christmas is itself that time of fulfillment. The promised Messiah has appeared on earth. Yet the manner of his coming—in poverty, in obscurity, in humility—points ahead to the destiny that he will suffer on the cross.
This third Sunday of Advent, I bring you news of a living reality that changes everything. Whatever your own personal darkness, it has been and will be overcome. If you are not patient, God will yet grant you patience. If you are not charitable, the Savior will create charity in you. If you are not forgiving, the Lord will work a wonder of forgiveness in you. The darkness has been overcome, and it will be overcome. "
C,Epiphany,,Fleming Rutledge,Means of Grace A Year of Weekly Devotions,Commentary,"It would be hard to say which is more alien to our contemporary ideas of getting ready for Christmas, the season of Advent or the figure of John the Baptist. All around the world, words are being read in churches that seem ill-suited to say the very least, to the anticipated holidays. “You brood of vipers! Even now the axe is laid to the root of the trees!” How would you like to get that on a Christmas card? But there it is…
What does it all mean? It means any number of things. It means that you are being changed and I am being changed. It means that we Christians are going to be weaned away from our possessions and oriented toward being everlastingly possessed by the love of God. It means that we will become less interested in receiving personal blessings for ourselves and more interested in making Christian hope known to those who “sit in darkness.” It means that we will become more and more thankful as we become less and less self-righteous. It means that we will gradually become less preoccupied with our own privileges and prerogatives and gradually see ourselves more and more in solidarity with other human beings who, like us, can receive mercy only from the hand of God and not because of any human superiority. Repentance will mean seeking after the good of all, not just the comforts of a few. "
D,TestSeason4,,Frederic Buechner,,Commentary,"WHAT IF ANYTHING have you and I done to do battle against the great darkness of things? As parents and the children of our own parents, as wives and husbands and friends and lovers, as players of whatever parts we have chosen to play in this world, as wielders of whatever kind of power, as possessors of whatever kind of wealth, what other human selves have we sacrificed something of our own sweet selves to help and heal? 
""Bear fruit that befits repentance!"" thunders the Baptist. ""Give us grace that we may cast away the works of darkness and put upon us the armor of light,"" whispers the prayer we pray. Bear fruit. Put on light like a garment, like a uniform. That is the place to stop and also the place to start. It is the place to stop and think—think back, think ahead, think deep. It is the place to start and be. "
